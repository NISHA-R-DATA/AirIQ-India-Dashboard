## üíº Business Problem
Despite growing **policy attention** and **public awareness**, **India's air quality** has remained **critically poor** in many cities, leading to **chronic health hazards** and **environmental degradation**. There exists a crucial need for:
- A **centralized, intuitive platform** to **monitor**, **analyze**, and **compare air pollution data** across **regions** and **timeframes**.
- **Actionable insights** to identify **pollution sources**, **seasonal spikes**, and **underperforming zones**.
- **Strategic recommendations** tailored to **pollutant types**, **geography**, and **risk levels**.

This project aims to bridge that gap through **dynamic**, **easy-to-interpret Tableau dashboards** grounded in real-world air quality data.

## üìä Key Insights

### 1. National Air Quality Overview: Stagnation Despite Efforts
Between 2021 and 2022, India recorded no significant improvement in national air quality, as evidenced by an unchanged average Air Quality Index (AQI) of **3.9** across **18.9K air quality data records**. While this signals a stabilization of overall conditions, it reflects a plateau rather than progress, despite increased policy focus and public engagement.
A marginal AQI decline of **less than 1%** indicates pockets of localized improvement; however, these are insufficient to constitute a national turnaround in air pollution control.



### 2. City-Level Extremes: Persistent Polluters and Clean Air Champions
- **Most Polluted City:**
  **Delhi** retained its status as India‚Äôs most polluted city for both years, with an average AQI of **4.8**‚Äîcategorized as "unhealthy." Key contributors include:
  - Vehicular emissions
  - Industrial discharges
  - Seasonal stubble burning

- **Least Polluted City:**
  **Aizawl** in Mizoram continued to rank as India‚Äôs cleanest city. Its naturally clean air can be attributed to:
  - Favorable topography
  - Limited industrial activity
  - High green cover



### 3. Seasonal Trends: Recurring and Predictable Patterns
Air quality followed a **seasonal rhythm** across both years:
- **Winter Peaks (Jan‚ÄìFeb, Oct‚ÄìDec):**
  - Pollution intensified due to temperature inversion, low wind speed, and use of solid fuels for heating.
- **Monsoon Relief (Jun‚ÄìAug):**
  - Rainfall significantly reduced airborne pollutants.
- **Pre-Monsoon Transition (Mar‚ÄìMay):**
  - Pollution levels gradually built up with rising temperatures and resumption of urban and agricultural burning activities.



### 4. Key Pollutants: Particulate Matter and Carbon Monoxide 
- **PM2.5 and PM10** levels exceeded **double the permissible limits** of India‚Äôs National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), indicating critical levels of:
  - Construction dust
  - Unregulated traffic emissions
  - Open biomass burning

- **Carbon Monoxide (CO)** also breached safety limits, especially in urban and peri-urban areas, primarily due to:
  - Vehicular pollution
  - Residential biomass combustion

Conversely, gases like **ozone, sulphur di oxide and nitrogen dioxide** remained largely within safe thresholds, underscoring the dominant role of fine particulate pollution.



### 5. High-Risk Zones: Year-Round Health Hazards
Cities such as **Delhi, Amritsar, Jorapokhar, and Patna** experienced "unhealthy" air for **over 95% of the year**, showing:
- Consistent PM2.5 and PM10 exceedances
- Frequent CO spikes‚Äîparticularly in **October and November**, driven by:
  - Diwali-related emissions
  - Crop residue burning

Though some CO spikes were short-lived, their frequency contributes to chronic exposure risk.


### 6. Moderately Polluted Cities: At Risk but Recoverable
Cities including **Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bhopal, Guwahati, and Visakhapatnam** maintained AQI levels between **3.2 and 4.1**, bordering high-risk thresholds.
- **Pollution Timing:** Peaks observed in **January‚ÄìMarch** and **November‚ÄìDecember**
- **Primary Pollutants:** PM2.5 and PM10
- **Encouraging Sign:** Cities like **Shillong** showed year-over-year improvement, hinting at the potential success of localized interventions such as:
  - Better traffic management
  - Construction dust regulation



### 7. Clean Air Cities: Sustainable Urban Planning Pays Off
Cities with AQI consistently below 3.3 included:
- **Thiruvananthapuram**
- **Bengaluru**
- **Kochi**
- **Coimbatore**
- **Ernakulam**
- **Aizawl**

**Common success factors:**
- Abundant green infrastructure
- Limited industrial footprint
- Effective urban planning
- Geography favorable to pollution dispersion

These cities serve as **models of sustainable air quality management**.



### 8. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights
- **Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10)** is the most critical pollutant nationwide.
- **Carbon monoxide** levels indicate severe vehicular and residential combustion challenges.
- **Seasonal weather patterns** exacerbate pollution in winter and mitigate it during monsoons.
- While nationwide air quality remained static, **city-level improvement** in the region like **Shillong** highlight the potential of targeted, data-driven interventions.
